Phase 1 Benchmark Report
========================
Date: 2026-01-13 10:50:40
Input File: funk-soul-guitar-clean-4_90bpm_G.wav
Duration: 5.33s (235200 samples @ 44100Hz)

Model Info
----------
Architecture: Causal TCN
Parameter Count: 113
Model Path: tcn_final.pt

Performance Metrics
-------------------
DSP Time: 0.004053s
NN Time:  0.014305s
Ratio:    NN is 3.53x slower than DSP

Real-Time Factor (RTF)
----------------------
(RTF < 1.0 means faster than real-time)
DSP RTF: 0.000760
NN RTF:  0.002682
NN Max Throughput: 16,442,378 samples/sec

Accuracy (NN validity)
----------------------
MSE (Mean Squared Error): 6.76e-02
Max Absolute Error:       0.9211

Notes
-----
- DSP is the 'Ground Truth' target.
- Low MSE indicates the NN has successfully learned the distortion function.
- If NN RTF > 1.0, the model is too heavy for real-time use on this CPU.
